#### Hi, thanks for checking out the source code. This project is built with VSCode, Gulp and Browserify. To set up the project, type the following into terminal (assuming you have npm and bower installed):

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

#### Build a new dist folder and copy all the assets etc:

```
$ gulp buildProd
```

#### Build a dev version and use your own live server:

```
$ gulp buildDev
```

#### Build a dev version and use watchify live server (this seems a little buggy at the moment and requires a browser refresh from time to time):

```
$ gulp go
```

#### Post on the web by copying the dist folder to your server. Please credit me and email me so that I can see your iteration. Have fun!
