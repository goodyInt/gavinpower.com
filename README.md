#  Hi, thanks for checking out the source code. This project is built with vs code, with gulp and browserify. To set up the project type the following into terminal (assuming you have npm and bower installed):

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

#### Then build a new dist folder and copy all the assets etc - type:

```
$ gulp buildProd
```

#### To build a dev build and use your own live server:

```
$ gulp buildDev
```

#### To build a dev build and use watchify live server (this seems a little buggy at the moment and requires a browser refresh from time to time):

```
$ gulp go
```

###### To go live on the web:  post the dist folder to your server
