###  Hi, thanks for checking out the source code. This project is built with vs code, gulp and browserify.

### To set up the project, type the following into terminal (assuming you have npm and bower installed):

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

#### Then build a new dist folder and copy all the assets etc:

```
$ gulp buildProd
```

#### To build a dev build and use your own live server:

```
$ gulp buildDev
```

#### To build a dev build and use watchify live server (this seems a little buggy at the moment and requires a browser refresh from time to time):

```
$ gulp go
```

#### Post on the web by coping the dist folder to your server. Please credit me and email me so that I could see your iterations. Have fun!
